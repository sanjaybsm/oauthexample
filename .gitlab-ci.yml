Certainly! To include GitLab secret for pushing the image to a GitLab repository, you can modify the  `.gitlab-ci.yml`  file as follows:
# Specify the stages of the CI/CD pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# Define the job for building the application
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - ./mvnw clean package

# Define the job for running tests
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - ./mvnw test

# Define the job for deploying the application
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "$DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME" --password-stdin $DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL/$CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE/$CI_PROJECT_NAME .
    - docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL/$CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE/$CI_PROJECT_NAME
  In this updated version, the  `deploy`  job uses the GitLab secret variables  `$DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME` ,  `$DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` , and  `$DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`  to authenticate and push the Docker image to the GitLab repository.
  
  Make sure to configure these secret variables in your GitLab project's CI/CD settings. Replace  `$DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME` ,  `$DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` , and  `$DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`  with the appropriate variable names for your setup.

Note: You may need to adjust the Docker image naming and repository URL based on your specific GitLab configuration.
  
  Feel free to modify this template further to suit your specific requirements or add additional steps as needed.
